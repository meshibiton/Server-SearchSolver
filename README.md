## General info
This project test 4 alog:BFS,DFS,A*,BestFS,each alog tested by 10 different matrices. 

The algorithm examines and print the cost of the path he chosed,the number of vertices 

he passed and the path itself(DOWN/UP/RIGHT/LEFT).

## Setup 

1. Notice: 5600 will be the port the server gonna listen for clients.

2. open terminal in the python tester("parallel_tester.py" ) folder and write "python2 parallel_tester.py"

3. In our tester folder there is 10 different matrices txt files that will be read by the program.
   
4. To compile your code open your terminal and write:

   g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread

5. To run  :running:  your code write: 

   ./a.out port
   
   in our case the port number is : 5600

## Status
Project is:  in progress.

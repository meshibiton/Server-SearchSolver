## General info
This project test 4 alog: BFS, DFS, A*, BestFS. each alog tested by 10 different matrices. 

The algorithm examines and print the cost of the path he chosed,the number of vertices 

he passed and the path itself(DOWN/UP/RIGHT/LEFT).

## Setup 

1. :pencil: Notice: 5600 will be the port the server is going to listen to clients.

2. Open terminal in the python tester folder and write "python2 parallel_tester.py"

3. In our tester folder there is 10 different matrices txt files that will be read by the program.
   
4. To compile your code open your terminal(another) and write:

   g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread

5. To run  :running:  your code write: 

   ./a.out port
   
   in our case the port number is : 5600
   
 6.Then ,finally click enter in the python terminal and you should receive a solution.

## Status
Project is:  in progress.
